Ok these are my files that we'll be referencing and using to make the tweaks i'm looking at today. we're going to fix them in small blocks at a time to make it manageable and precise. I need to know EXACT locations on where to either place them before/after/or paste over. Pull those EXACT locations directly form the files i've attached.

Let's try to solve things in the conversation and only use canvas if we're going to have to replace a very large block.

do you understand the parameters of this project so far?
